YOLOv8 - Based AI Solutions for Intelligent Crowd Management and Crime Prevention via CCTV

📌 Overview
This project presents an AI-powered surveillance system designed for intelligent crowd management and crime prevention using CCTV footage. The system utilizes YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection models to analyze images and videos in real time.

The system helps in identifying suspicious activities, monitoring crowd density, and generating alerts to enhance public safety.

🎯 Objectives
- Detect suspicious activities from images
- Monitor crowd density in public areas
- Generate alerts for abnormal situations
- Provide visual analytics using graphs and dashboard

🚀 Features
- 🔍 Crime detection using YOLOv8 model
- 👥 Crowd detection from images and videos
- 🎥 Frame-by-frame video analysis
- ⚠️ Real-time alert system
- 📊 Crowd density visualization using graphs
- 📈 Dashboard for monitoring statistics
- 📝 Detection history and logging system

🛠️ Tech Stack

🧠 System Architecture
User uploads image/video → Flask Server → YOLOv8 Model → Detection Processing → Alert Generation → Graph & Result Display → Web Interface

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images and videos collected from publicly available sources for academic and research purposes.

The dataset includes:
- Crime-related scenarios
- Crowd images and videos

These datasets were used to train and evaluate the YOLOv8 models.

Due to large size and usage constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.

🧪 Model Training
The YOLOv8 models were trained using labeled datasets for crime detection and crowd analysis.

Training process includes:
- Data collection and annotation
- Model training using Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Model evaluation and optimization

📊 Outputs
- Detection results → `static/results/`
- Crowd graphs → `static/graphs/`
- Logs → `static/logs/`

⚠️ Important Notes
- Model files are not included due to GitHub file size limitations
- Dataset is not included in the repository
- This application runs on a local server

📈 Future Enhancements
- Real-time CCTV integration
- Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure / GCP)
- Mobile application development
- Automated SMS/Email alert system
- Integration with smart city systems
